"Clemente Ader in his Eole. This ‘flight’ is noted as 
an ‘uncontrolled hop’.","Photographed and witnessed unofficially, this re-
cord was set by the Wright brothers in their Wright 
Flyer.","Set by Alberto Santos-Dumont in a 14-bis propeller 
aircraft. A month earlier and using the same air-
craft, he had matched the Wright brother’s record 
in the First officially witnessed and certified flight.","Set by Wilbur Wright in a Biplane propeller air-
craft at Auovors. ","Set by Luois Paulhan in the Farman propeller air-
craft at Lyon. Earlier in July of the same year he 
set a record of 150 m at the Duoai Air Show.","Set by Archibald Hoxsey in the Wright Model B pro-
peller air-craft at the second International Aviation 
Meet held in 1910 at Dominguez Field, Los Angeles. 
Hoxsey died in a plane crash five days later while 
trying to set a new record. 

This broke three records set earlier in the same 
year: in January, Luois Paulhan reached an altitude
 of 1269 m in the Farman propeller aircraft at the 
Los Angeles Air Meet; in June, Walter Brookins 
set a new record of 1403 m in the Wright biplane 
propeller aircraft; in October, using the same air-
craft, Ralph Johnstone almost doubled the old 
record to 2582 m at the International Aviation 
Tournament, at the Belmont Park race track in 
Elmont, New York.","Set by Roland Garros in the Bleriot monoplane 
propeller aircraft, at Saint-Brieuc, France.","Set by Joseph Eugene Carberry in the Curtiss Mo-
del E propeller aircraft.","Set by Guido Guidi in the Caudron G.4 propeller 
aircraft at Torino Mirafiori airfield.","Set by Jean Casale in the Nieuport NiD.29 propell-
er aircraft.","Set by Major Rudolf Schroeder in the LUSAC-11 
propeller aircraft.","Set by Lt. John Arthur Macready in the LUSAC-11 
propeller aircraft.","Set by Joseph Sadi-Lecointe in the Nieuport 
NiD.40R propeller aircraft, breaking his prior re-
cord (10740 m) set two months earlier in thes sa-
me aircraft.","Set by Jean Callizo in the Gourdou-Leseurre 40 C.1 
propeller aircraft. Callizo later claimed several hi-
gher records, but these were stripped from him, 
as he had falsified barograph readings.","Set by Lt. Apollo Soucek, USN in the Wright Apa-
che propeller aircraft.","Set by Cyril Uwins in the Vickers Vespa propeller 
aircraft.","Set by Gustave Lemoine in the Potez 506 propeller
aircraft.","Set by Renato Donati in the Caproni Ca.113 AQ 
propeller aircraft.","Set by Squadron Leader Francis Ronald Swain in a 
Bristol Type 138 propeller aircraft, breaking Geor-
ges Detre’s record of 14843 m set a month earlier 
in a Potez 506 propeller aircraft (the highest alti-
tude reached with no pressure suit).","Set by Lt. Colonel Mario Pezzi in a Caparoni Ca.161 
manned propeller-driven biplane, breaking M. J.
 Adam’s record of 16440 m set in June of the same 
year in a Bristol Type 138 pro-peller aircraft. This is 
the current altitude record for a manned 
propeller-driven biplane.","Set by Einar Enevoldson and other, and two scien-
tists in the Grob Strato 2C.  This is the current alti-
tude record for a manned propeller-driven mono-
plane.",
