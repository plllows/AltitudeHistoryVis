"[ancient] The bodies of three children were disco-
vered at the summit of Llullaillaco in South America, 
as Inca sacrifices dated to around AD 1500 (although 
there is no direct evidence that the Incas reached 
higher points).","Matthias Zurbriggen set this record in the first rec-
orded ascent of Aconcagua in the Andes.","Tom George Longstaff, accompanied by the alpine 
guides Alexis and Henri Brocherel from Courmayeur 
and six local porters, made an attempt on Gurla 
Mandhata. The height they reached is estimated at 
between 7,000 and 7,300 m.","Norwegians Carl W. Rubenson and Monrad Aas 
came within 50m of ascending the 7338m east 
summit of Kabru. ","During his expedition to the Karakoram, the Duke 
of the Abruzzi made an attempt on Chogolisa, 
where he reached a height of approximately 7,500 m 
before being forced back, around just 150 m below 
the summit, by poor weather.","On the 1922 British expedition to Mount Everest, 
the altitude record was broken twice. On 20 May, 
George Mallory, Howard Somervell, and Edward 
Norton reached 8,170 m on the moun-tain’s North 
Ridge without using supplemental oxygen. Three 
days later George Finch and Geoffrey Bruce, using 
supplemental oxygen, reached 8,320 m on the 
same route, turning around when Bruce’s oxygen 
apparatus failed.","In another British attempt on Everest, Edward Nor-
ton, without supplemental oxygen, reached a point 
on the mountain’s Great Couloir 8,570 m high. This 
altitude record would not be broken, with certain-
ty, until the 1950s, or without supplemental oxy-
gen until 1978.","In the first attempt to climb Everest from the south, 
Raymond Lambert and the Swiss team’s Nepali In-
dian sardar Tenzing Norgay reached an altitude of 
approximately 8,600 m, slightly higher than the 
previous altitude record set by the British on the 
north side of the mountain. ","On 26 May, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans rea-
ched the South Summit before turning back due to 
malfunctioning oxygen apparatus. Their height of 
8,760 m was a new but short lived altitude record 
(also summit record if this is taken to include minor 
tops as well as genuine mountains).
 
Only three days later, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing 
Norgay would reach the true summit of Mount 
Everest, marking the final chapter in the history 
of mountaineering altitude record. While the 
exact height of Everest’s summit is subject to mi-
nor variation due to the level of snow cover and 
the gradual upthrust of the Himalaya, significant 
changes to the world altitude record are now im-
possible.",,,,
