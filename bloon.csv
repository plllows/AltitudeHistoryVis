"24 m marks the altitude reached by man’s first as-
cent in a hot-air balloon, by Jean-Francois de Rozier 
of France. Just four months later in the same year, 
Jacques Alexandre Charles and his assistant Marie-
Noel Robert, both of France, would make man’s 
first ascent in a hydrogen balloon to about 610 m. 
Charles then ascended alone to a record altitude of 
2.7 km.","Pilatre de Rozier and the chemist Joseph Proust in 
a Montgolfier.","Etienne-Gaspard Robert and Auguste Lhoest in a 
balloon.",Charles Green and Spencer Rush in a free balloon.,"Henry Coxwell and James Glaisher in a balloon fill-
ed with coal gas. Glaisher lost consciousness during 
the ascent due to the low air pressure and cold tem-
perature of -11 degrees Celsius.","Arthur Berson and Reinhard Suring in the hydrogen 
balloon Preu(B)en, in an open basket and with oxy-
gen in steel cylinders. This flight contributed to the 
discovery of the stratosphere.","Captain Hawthorne C. Gray, of the U.S. Army Air 
Corps, in a helium balloon. Capt. Gray was killed 
when his oxygen supply ran out.","Auguste Piccard and Paul Kipfer in a hydrogen ball-
oon.","Auguste Piccard and Max Cosyns in a hydrogen 
balloon.","Lt. Comdr. Thomas G. W. Settle (USN) and Maj. 
Chester L. Fordney (USMC) in Century of Progress 
balloon. This ascent broke the record set only two 
months earlier by USSR balloon USSR-1 by only 
300 feet.","USSR balloon Osoaviakhi-1. The three crew were 
killed when the balloon broke up during the des-
cent.","Captain O. A. Anderson and Captain A. W. Stevens 
(U.S. Army Air Corps) ascended in the Explorer II 
gondola from the Stratobowl, near Rapid City, 
South Dakota, for a flight that lasted 8 hours 13 
minutes and covered 362 kilometres (225 mi).","Malcolm D. Ross and M. L. Lewis (U.S. Navy) in 
Office of Naval research Strato-Lab I, using a press-
urised gondola and plastic balloon launching near 
Rapid City, South Dakota, and landing 282 km (173 
mi) near Kennedy, Nebraska.","Major David Simons (U.S. Air Force) ascended from 
the Portsmouth Mine near Crosby, Minnesota in 
the Manhigh 2 gondola for a 32 hour record-break-
ing flight, breaking the record set two months 
earlier in the same year by Captain Joseph W. Kitt-
inger (U.S. Air Force) in the Project Manhigh 1 by 
almost 2 km.","In testing a high-altitude parachute system, Joseph 
Kittinger of the U.S. Air Force parachuted from the 
Excelsior III balloon over New Mexico at 33.3 km. 
He set world records for: high-altitude jump; free-
fall diving by falling 26 km before opening his para-
chute; and fastest speed achieved by a human with-
out motorized assistance (998 km/h).","Commander Malcolm D. Ross and Lieutenant Com-
mander Victor A. Prather, Jr., of the U.S. Navy 
ascended in the StratoLab V, in an unpressurised 
gondola. After descending, the gondola containing 
the two balloonists landed in the Gulf of Mexico. 
Prather slipped off the rescue helicopter’s hook 
into the gulf and drowned.","The amateur parachutist Nicholas Piantanida of 
the United States reached 37.7 km with his “Strato 
Jump II”  balloon, but because of his being unable 
to disconnect his oxygen line from the main cap-
sule’s feed he had to detach the balloon from the 
capsule, abandon his planned parachute jump, and 
return to the ground in the capsule without the ball-
oon. 

Because of the design of his glove, he was un-
able to reattach his safety harness. He endured 
very great g-forces, but he survived the descent. 

Piantanida‘s ascent is not recognised by the Fede-
ration Aeronautique Internationale as a balloon 
altitude world record because he did not return 
with his balloon.","Felix Baumgartner in the Red Bull Stratos reached 
38969 metres in a balloon flight that started near 
Roswell, New Mexico, and he returned to earth via 
a record-setting parachute jump.","Alan Eustace, a senior vice president at Google, 
reached 41,424 metres in a helium balloon and 
then returned to earth via parachute jump.",description
