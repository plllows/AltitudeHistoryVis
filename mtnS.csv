"The surveyors of the Great Trigonometric Survey 
climbed several peaks of over 6,400 m in order to 
make observations.","William Johnson of the Great Trigonometric Sur-
vey claimed to have clibed a 7,284 m peak during 
an illicit journey into China, but the actual height 
of the mountain he climbed has since been mea-
sured at 6,710 m.","Matthias Zurbriggen set this record in the first re-
corded ascent of Aconcagua in the Andes.","Longstaff and the Brocherel brothers returned to 
the Himalayas and led an expedition with the aim 
of climbing Nanda Devi, but instead turned their 
attention to Trisul. At 7,120 m, Trisul became the 
highest summit to have been climbed whose 
height was accurately known and whose ascent 
was undisputed.","Alex Kellas, a Scottish chemist, explorer, and 
mountaineer, together with the Sherpas “Sony” 
and “Tuny’s brother” broke the undisputed sum-
mit record when they climbed the 7,128 m high 
Pauhunri on the border of Sikkim and Tibet.","German mountaineers Karl Wien and Eugen Allwein 
and the Austrian mountaineer and cartographer 
Erwin Schneider reached the summit of the 7134 m 
Kaufman Peak in the Pam-irs, a mountain up to 
that year thought to be the highest mountain in 
the Soviet Union. After the expedition, it was re-
named Lenin Peak.","In an international expedition to the Kanchenjunga 
led by Gunter Dyhrenfurth, Erwin Schneider solo-
climbed 7,177 m Nepal Peak near Kirat Chuli in late 
May. Only a few days later on the 3rd of June, to-
gether with Hermann Hoerlin, Schneider would 
climb the Jongsong Peak, planting a Swabian and 
Tyrolean flag on top.","Frank Smythe, Eric Shipton, R.L. Holdsworth and 
Lewa Sherpa reached the summit of Kamet in June. ","The summit record was raised once more before 
the Second World War brought an effective halt 
to mountaineering in the Himalaya, when Bill 
Tilman and Noel Odell scaled the Nanda Devi.","Annapurna became the first mountain over eight 
thousand metres to be climbed when it was sca-
led by French climbers Maurice Herzog and Luois 
Lachenal. Both climbers lost their toes and Herzog 
most of his fingers to frostbite.","On 26 May, Tom Bourdillon and Charles Evans rea-
ched the South Summit before turning back due to 
malfunctioning oxygen apparatus. Their height of 
8,760 m was a new but short lived altitude record 
(also summit record if this is taken to include minor 
tops as well as genuine mountains).
 
Only three days later, Edmund Hillary and Tenzing 
Norgay would reach the true summit of Mount 
Everest, marking the final chapter in the history 
of mountaineering altitude record. While the 
exact height of Everest’s summit is subject to mi-
nor variation due to the level of snow cover and 
the gradual upthrust of the Himalaya, significant 
changes to the world altitude record are now im-
possible.
